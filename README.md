<ul>
<li><b>Branch</b> - In Github, a branch is an independent line of development. It is a set of code changes unique to that branch. For example, you can have a branch called main, where you make the main changes of a program, and a branch called test, where you make only experimental changes to a program.
  <li><b>Clone</b> - Cloning in github means to make a copy of an existing repository in a new directory, at another location. 
  <li><b>Commit</b> - Commiting in git creates a snapshot of the project's current changes and saves them.
  <li><b>Fetch</b> - Fetching in git allows you to take commits and files from a remote repository into your local repository. This can let you see what other people have been working on.
  <li><b>Git</b> - Git is a version control software that helps to track and manage changes to code. This is useful for teams or companies, though it can also be used by individuals. 
<li><b>Github</b> - Github is a website for hosting projects that use git. 
  <li><b>Merge</b> - Merging in git allows you to take independent branches of development and combine them together into a single branch. 
  <li><b>Merge Conflict</b> - Merge conflicts are errors that occur when one developer tries to edit code that another developer is also editing. When git combines separate branches, these conflicts will have to be resolved, either by choosing one version of the code or scrapping it altogether. 
  <li><b>Push</b> - Pushing in git allows you to upload your local repository content onto a remote repository, such as github. 
  <li><b>Pull</b> - Pulling in git allows you to download content from a remote repository such as github and immediately update the local repository on your machine to match that remote repository. 
  <li><b>Remote</b> - Remotes in git are common repositories that members of a group can use to exchange each of their respective changes. An example of a place where remote repositories are hosted is Github.
  <li><b>Repository</b> - Repositories in git hold files for various different versions of a project. These files are uploaded by users and can be edited through further committing and pushing. Code in a repository can also be downloaded onto a user's local machine.

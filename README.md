<ul>
<li><b>Branch</b> - In Github, a branch is an independent line of development. It is a set of code changes unique to that branch. For example, you can have a branch called main, where you make the main changes of a program, and a branch called test, where you make only experimental changes to a program.
  <li><b>Clone</b> - Cloning in github means to make a copy of an existing repository in a new directory, at another location. 
  <li><b>Commit</b> - Commiting in git creates a snapshot of the project's current changes and saves them.
  <li><b>Fetch</b> - Fetching in git allows you to take commits and files from a remote repository into your local repository. This can let you see what other people have been working on.
